          <p class="modal-profile-title">Jeanette D. Hsu Endowed Chair in Cell Biology, MD Anderson Cancer Center</p>
          <p class="modal-description">Dr. Sharma is a nationally and internationally renowned physician scientist whose researchwork is focused on investigating mechanisms and pathways within the immune system that facilitate tumor rejection or elicit resistance to immune checkpoint therapy. She is a Professor in the departments of Genitourinary Medical Oncology and Immunology, Associate VP of Immunobiology and the T.C. and Jeanette D. Hsu Endowed Chair in Cell Biology, at MD Anderson Cancer Center. She is also the inaugural Scientific Director for the Immunotherapy Platform at MD Anderson Cancer Center. As Scientific Director, she designs and supervises immune monitoring studies for over 100 different immunotherapy clinical trials. In 2022 she became the Director of Scientific Programs for the James P. Allison Institute at MD Anderson.</p>
          <p class="modal-description">Dr. Sharma is a member of the American Society for Clinical Investigation (ASCI). She received the Emil Frei III Award for Excellence in Translational Research in 2016, the Coley Award for Distinguished Research for Tumor Immunology in 2018, the Women in Science with Excellence (WISE) award in 2020, the Heath Memorial Award in 2021 and the Randall Prize for Excellence in Cancer Research in 2021.</p>
          <p class="modal-description">Dr. Sharma has mentored over 50 graduate students, medical students, postdoctoral fellows, clinical fellows, and junior faculty since 2005. She also mentors undergraduate summer students, including underrepresented minorities from Puerto Rico and Howard University, each summer. She is currently mentoring 3 post docs, 3 graduate students, 2 clinical fellows and 4 junior faculty. She provides excellent leadership, guidance, expertise and invests her time for the success of the careers of these young scientists.</p>
          <p class="modal-description">In 2006, Dr. Sharma designed and conducted the first neoadjuvant (pre-surgical) trial, also known as a window-of-opportunity trial, with immune checkpoint therapy (anti-CTLA-4, ipilimumab), which allowed her to establish safety of the neoadjuvant approach for immune checkpoint therapy as well as provide tumor tissues for translational research studies. She identified the ICOS/ICOSL pathway as a novel target for cancer immunotherapy strategies. The neoadjuvant clinical trial in 2006 was also the first trial with immune checkpoint therapy in patients with bladder cancer. The clinical data indicated that 25% of patients had significant anti-tumor responses with pathologic complete responses. These data led Dr. Sharma to conduct additional clinical trials with immune checkpoint therapy (anti-PD-1, nivolumab) for patients with bladder cancer, which enabled FDA-approval of nivolumab as treatment for patients with metastatic bladder cancer. Dr. Sharma also led the clinical trials with immune checkpoint therapy (nivolumab and nivolumab plus ipilimumab) in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which led to FDA-approval of these agents as treatment for patients with RCC.</p>
          <p class="modal-description">Dr. Sharma is the Principal Investigator for multiple immunotherapy clinical trials. Her studies have identified novel resistance mechanisms, including loss of interferon (IFN) signaling, VISTA+ immunosuppressive cells, increased EZH2 expression in T cells, TGFB signaling in bone metastases, and CD73+ myeloid cells in GBM. Her work continues to drive the development of immunotherapy strategies for the treatment of cancer patients.</p>
          <p class="modal-description">Dr. Sharma holds a Ph.D. in immunology and an M.D. from Pennsylvania State University. She completed her clinical residency at New York Hospital, Cornell Medical Center in New York, and her clinical fellowship was completed at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.</p>

          <p class="modal-description">Harold Varmus, M.D., co-recipient of the 1989 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for studies of the genetic basis of cancer, joined the Meyer Cancer Center of Weill Cornell Medicine as the Lewis Thomas University Professor of Medicine in 2015. He is also a Senior Associate Member of the New York Genome Center, where he helps to develop programs in cancer genomics, and an adjunct professor at Columbia University, where he teaches an undergraduate course about the scientific enterprise. Previously, Dr. Varmus was the Director of the National Cancer Institute for five years (2010-2015), the President of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center for ten years (2000-2010), and Director of the National Institutes of Health for six years (1993-1999). A graduate of Amherst College and Harvard University in English literature and of Columbia University in medicine, he was further trained at Columbia University Medical Center, the National Institutes of Health, and the University of California San Francisco (UCSF), before becoming a member of the UCSF basic science faculty for over two decades.</p>

          <p class="modal-profile-title">Assistant Dean For Student Diversity and Aligned Pre-Doctoral Programs & Associate Director for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, SBU Cancer Center, Stony Brook University</p>
          <p class="modal-description">Dr. Williams attended Savannah State University (BS), Tuskegee University (MS), and Purdue University (Ph.D.). She conducted her postdoctoral work at Harvard prior to joining the Institute for Cancer Prevention in Valhalla, New York. After joining Stony Brook University as a Research Associate, Dr. Williams was promoted to Research Instructor of Medicine and then to Associate Professor with tenure.</p>
          <p class="modal-description">Dr. Williams’ initial cancer research centered on evaluation of the efficacy and mode of action of both “standard of care” and novel chemotherapeutic agents. This work utilized formulated derivatives of Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as chemotherapeutic agents against cancer progression. Using commercially available cell lines, her group defined the mechanistic role of NF-κB and other transcription factors in response to novel derivatives of NSAIDs in colon cancer.</p>
          <p class="modal-description">The focus of Dr. Williams’ current research is on defining and addressing racial disparities in cancer. Her group seeks to understand the causes of cancer in general, both external and internal factors, and to define those dysregulations that result in differential rates of disease incidence and mortality between racial and ethnic groups. In her laboratory they are investigating this through molecular and chemotherapeutic assessments.</p>
          <p class="modal-description">Dr. Williams’ research focus turned to cancer racial disparities to address a glaring gap. Although African Americans have higher cancer incidence and mortality rates than any other racial or ethnic group, knowledge about treatment and tumor biology was generated from in vitro and in vivo models of Caucasian American patients or those of undefined race and ethnicity. We know that one size does not fit all. There are differences within and between groups, and from individual to individual. This understanding accelerated an interest in personalized medicine but until recently, this did not always factor in race, ethnicity, or gender. A root cause of this problem was that colon cancer models that varied by race and ethnicity were not readily available for research. To address this issue, Dr. Williams’ group generated diverse colon cancer cell lines (2D models). They are now generating diverse organoids (3D models) and patient derived xenografts (PDXs) to better recapitulate conditions in the human body. This is effectively being evaluated with the assistance of several collaborations.</p>
          <p class="modal-description">Dr. Williams’ group is addressing the underlying genetic/regulatory causes associated with cancer disparities. They are particularly interested in the association of inherent and acquired genetic mutations, aberrant DNA methylation, differential microbiome profiles, miRNA dysregulation as it relates to cancer disparity, and general response to chemotherapeutic agents. Their hypothesis is that differential expression and dysregulation of these factors are in part accountable for the disparity in incidence of cancers seen in African Americans as compared to other racial and ethnic groups. With this systematic approach they are assessing how genetic and epigenetic dysregulation relate to disparities in cancer incidence and death rates between African-, Hispanic-, and Caucasian Americans</p>
